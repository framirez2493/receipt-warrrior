# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
   everyone who buys anything with warranty
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
  keeps you organized and updated about your warranties form products that you have.

  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
  piece of mind less stress about what happens if something breaks and whre the warranty is it.
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
  i want to be able to keeep records
users buy product and with it they get 10 pappers with the warranty with our product you can go paperless
and keep it organize it and upto date.
* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to be able to keep all my warranties handy and paperless and know coverage expiration date and return policy.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to provide a copy of my receipt (this could be a link to image of the receipt).
  3. As a user, I want to be able to search through my warranties and get notifications from expiring warranty or closing to expire. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
